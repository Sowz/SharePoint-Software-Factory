<h3>SPSF is based on open technology by Microsoft</h3>
Recipes for SharePoint SoftwareFactory is based on the free Microsoft Guidance Automation Extensions (GAX). This toolkit is used to create software factories and several software factories are already provided by Microsoft, e.g. SFSF Smart Client Software Factory, WSSF Web Service Software Factory etc.

<h3>SPSF is NOT "yet another SharePoint framework"</h3>
We want to make sure that SPSF is not a SharePoint framework which needs to be installed in SharePoint or has dependencies to custom assemblies for SharePoint applications.

<ul>
	<li>SPSF helps to generate SharePoint code like an experienced developer would write. The generated code is based on our projects or taken from MSDN.</li>
	<li>There is no dependency to SPSF. Projects created with SPSF can be opended and compiled on any other computer with Visual Studio.</li>
</ul>
